What I learned:
During this project i've learned how to apply the css framework(Tailwind) to make my styling easier.
Which has also taught me a new way of how to apply css without creating a new .css file, i've also learned that it's key to make sure you HTML structure and syntax is correct.

Struggles:
My main struggle like in my last few projects was my understanding of how flexbox and grid works.
At the begging of the project was how to properly specify what a <container>'s class is.

Improvements:
Broaden my understanding of flex and grid which will be key for future projects.
